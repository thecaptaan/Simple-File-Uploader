# Simple File Uploader

The Simple File Uploader in Node.js is a basic tool that helps you send files from your computer to a server. It's easy to use. You just pick the file you want to upload, and it tells you some basic things about the file, like its name, size, and what type of file it is. When you're ready, it sends the file over to the server. It's really straightforward and gets the job done without any fuss.
